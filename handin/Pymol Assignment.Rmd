#The active site of the protein 2PTC
<p>
![](handin1.png)
</p>

Figure 1: The active site consisting of the residues HIS57, ASP102 and SER195 is shown is cyan. The inhibitor residues consist of dark red and light red parts. The dark red parts of the residue are within 4 Angstrom of the active site while the light red parts are further away. The thin blue wires represent chain E, where the active site is located and the thin red wires represent chain I, where the inhibitor residues are located.
