#Protein
Based on my name, I selected a protein complex with a PDB ID of 1HDI. This protein complex consists of a 3-Phospgogylerate kinase from Pig muscle complexed with 3-Phosphoglueric acid (3PG), an Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP) and a Magnesium ion. 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a typical kinase with two structural domains, and each domain binds to one of the two substrates , 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and MgATP. For the phospho-transfer reaction to take place the substrates must be brought closer by a hinge-bending domain closure.

#Structure
- **Biology:** 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a typical kinase with two structural domains. The domains each bind one of the two substrates, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and MgATP
- **Ligands:** 
    - 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG)
    - Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP)
    - Magnesium Ion (MG)
- **Experimental methods:** X-ray diffraction was used to identify the structure of the protein complex. 

#Structure quality
- **Resoluton:** 1.8A. This resolution is acceptable.
- **Free R-value:** 0.262. This R value is not very good but it is still acceptable.
- **B factor:** None as EDS was not executed
- **Ramachandran plot results:** 96.8% of all residues were found in favored regions and 99.8% of all residues in alloweed regions. Only one outlier existed (37-ALA). The results are acceptable but could have been better.

Overall, the structural quality of the data is acceptable, but not very good. The B factor values are missing so the quality has poential to be even worse.

#Biological and asymmetric units
The biological and asymmetric units are identical.
